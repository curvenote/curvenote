title: Figure Count

+++ { "id": "figure-count:overview" }

Manuscript figure count must fit within the specified limit. By default this count includes all numbered, inset content (e.g. figures, tables, proofs, etc.; not equations though). It may also apply only to a specific `kind` of figure to limit the count to only `figure`, `table`, `proof`, etc.
