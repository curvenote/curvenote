[![jtex on npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/jtex.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jtex)

`jtex` is a command line tool (CLI) for rendering LaTeX documents from Jinja-style templates. This package uses [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) as the template engine with a modified environment and syntax that plays well with LaTeX's markup.

**Goals**

- Provide a data-driven templating markup for LaTeX
- Provide validation of templates and supplied options when rendering a template
- Work with standardized frontmatter to make authors, affiliations, etc. easy to template
- Work with the MyST ecosystem of tools
- Support many user supplied templates, local templates, etc.

**Not Goals**

- Translation to LaTeX, instead see `myst-to-tex` or [using pandoc](pandoc-comparison.md)

## Installation

Install the package into your virtual environment using npm:

```bash
npm install jtex
```

and confirm correct installation by typing:

```bash
jtex --version
```

## Usage with MyST

The main usage for `jtex` is with `myst` and `curvenote` command line tools,
both of which can compile markdown into LaTeX for templating with `jtex`.

## Simple Example

A document can be used very simply with the document as `doc`, the contents of which are
documented in [](document.md).

```latex
% template.tex
\documentclass{article}

[-IMPORTS-]

\title{[-doc.title-]}
\author{[-doc.authors[0].name-] ([-doc.authors[0].email-])}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

[-CONTENT-]
\vskip 1cm
The End!
\end{document}
```
