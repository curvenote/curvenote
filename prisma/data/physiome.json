      "title": "The Boron & De Weer Model of Intracellular pH Regulation",
      "description": "The classic Boron & De Weer (1976) paper provided the first evidence of active regulation of pH in cells by an energy-dependent acid-base transporter. This Physiome paper seeks to make that model, and the experimental conditions under which it was developed, available in a reproducible and well-documented form, along with a software implementation that makes the model easy to use and understand.",
